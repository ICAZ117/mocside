export default {};
// * Add profile Page....sorta like a dashboard
// * Overall Course Grades
// * Profile Settings.....username, email, password, profile picture, delete account?...if professor upgrade button
// * IDE Settings......Theme, language, Console Theme

//i'm imagining a tab with the tab panels on the left side of the screen in a column
//list of tabs in descending order
//overview, grades, security, profile(maybe this should be on overview), IDE/Console
//in overview there will be cards to access the different tabs, without using the links in the left side
//the overview card will have a profile picture, screen name, full name, perhaps a delete button at the bottom
//grades will show the overall grades for all past and present courses, and pehaps a small column of recents on the right to show recently graded projects
//security will have change username, change password, change email
//IDE will allow the user to change the theme of ace, change the default language(is there any need for this?), and change the console theme, once we implement that
