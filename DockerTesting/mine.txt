upon submit

lets assume we have a file with:
	student code
	some input
	proper output?....not needed if student running own tests

for now assume we have:
	student code
	student input
	no output to test against....jsut return output


assuming we already have the image to run it:
	we grab either java or python image
	we create a new instance(container) of the docker image
	it grabs the code and input
	(in java we would compile)
	in python we just run the python code and pass the input...
	docker receives/or produces output
	docker saves output in file for back end to grab
